Python generator is one of the most useful and special python function ever. We can turn a function to behave as an iterator using python generators.


#sample syntax of python generator
def gereratorName(argument):
   #statements
       yield argument
   #statements


#calling the generator
variableName = gereratorName(10)
print(variableName)

In the above structure you can see that everything is just like a function except one thing, that is the yield keyword. This keyword plays the vital role. Only the usage of yield, changes a normal function into a generator.

A normal function returns some value, generator yields some value. A generator automatically implements next() and _iter_.

Remember range() is a built-in generator which generates number within the upper bound. Hope you can now write your own generator.
