How to create a set?
A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {}, separated by comma or by using the built-in function set().

It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, tuple, string etc.). But a set cannot have a mutable element, like list, set or dictionary, as its element.

# set of integers

my_set = {1, 2, 3}

print(my_set)


# set of mixed datatypes

my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}

print(my_set)

Creating an empty set is a bit tricky.

Empty curly braces {} will make an empty dictionary in Python. To make a set without any elements we use the set() function without any argument.

# initialize my_set
my_set = {1,3}
print(my_set)

# if you uncomment line 9,
# you will get an error
# TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing

#my_set[0]

# add an element
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(2)
print(my_set)

# add multiple elements
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set.update([2,3,4])
print(my_set)

# add list and set
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
my_set.update([4,5], {1,6,8})
print(my_set)
