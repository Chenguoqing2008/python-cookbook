namespace
A namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that¡¯s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as abs(), and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The important thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces; for instance, two different modules may both define a function maximize without confusion ¡ª users of the modules must prefix it with the module name.

scope
A scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. ¡°Directly accessible¡± here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace.
