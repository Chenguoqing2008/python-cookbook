So what is virtualenv? Virtualenv is a tool which allows us to make isolated python environments. Imagine you have an application that needs version 2 of a library, but another application requires version 3. How can you use and develop both these applications?

If you install everything into /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (or whatever your platform¡¯s standard location is), it¡¯s easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade a package.

To install it, just type this command in the shell:

$ pip install virtualenv
The most important commands are:

$ virtualenv myproject
$ source myproject/bin/activate
This first one makes an isolated virtualenv environment in the myproject folder and the second command activates that isolated environment.

If you want your virtualenv to have access to your systems site-packages, use the --system-site-packages switch when creating your virtualenv like this:

$ virtualenv --system-site-packages mycoolproject
You can turn off the env by typing:

$ deactivate
